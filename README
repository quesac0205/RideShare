Important points to remember:
=> Make sure to use the course VM running g++ compiler to form the executable 


Directory Structure:
 # ls -l
- a4
- Controller.cc
- Controller.h

- Customer.cc
- Customer.h

- defs.h
- Drawable.cc
- Drawable.h

- Driver.cc
- Driver.h

- List.h
- Location.cc
- Location.h

- main.cc
- Makefile
- README

- RideShare.cc
- RideShare.h

- User.cc
- User.h

- View.cc
- View.h


How to form a executable using Makefile:
=> using the following command will make an executable file by named of a4 in assignment4 directory 
$ make
$ ./a4 (to run the executable)


How to clean the object files:
=> using the following command will clean all the executables and object files
$ make clean
